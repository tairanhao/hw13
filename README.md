# Drawing arm

Use hand gesture(motion) to control the servos that connect with a sharpie.

## Summary

use arduino uno, servo motors to build a robotic arm that can draw something by simply using hand gesture to give orders.
Using processing,arduino and artificial intelligence learning software(wekinator) to make sure the servos can interact with the input.

## Component Parts

Arduino uno, jumping wires, breadboard, leap motion, servos, brackets, processing, arduino, wekinator

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: Write Proposal, flush out initial code for your idea
- Week 2: Connect the servos with arduino; connect input and output data in wekinator.
- Week 3: Build the arms, and put the input data and output data into wekinator.
- Week 4: Present!
 
## Challenges

It was hard to find the reference sources and package for input in wekinator, also there was a library that 
I have to find it on the internet in order to connect the processing and arduino.

## Completed Work

Upload photos and videos of your completed final project!

Also upload the code that makes up your project to your repository.
